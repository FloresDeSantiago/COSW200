                           Describe the purpose of this JS library/framework.
                           Why was it created?
                           What are the selling points for using this JS library/framework over another?
                           summarize this information in a minimum of 2-3 paragraphs.
                           Include links to the websites listed above and at least ONE other website that you have used for your research.

                            Vue.JS is a lightweight framework rivaling those of Angular and React which are used to create interactivity within a web page. Furthermore the purpose of Vue.JS is to create user interfaces much more fluidly. While there are several other frameworks out in the market right now. Vue.JS selling points would be the fact that it such a lightweight framework in comparison to React, Node, or Angular. This is a huge selling point when other frameworks have a lot more fluff to them. Not to mention that because their documentation is well-thought out and understandable, it is easier for people to pick it and learn it more quickly then other frameworks.

                        As long as the user has an understanding of HTML and Javascript they will be able to pick up this framework and advanced their skill much easier and faster then when using another framework. This framework allows for the flexibility to allow the programmer to write code in what they feel more comfortable doing. There is not rigid structure like other frameworks which means the ability to pick it up is quicker because it is not limiting you to code in a certain way. Finally, they include transitions and much more aesthetically-pleasing resources that create professional looking websites quicker.

                     The first source is actual part one in a 7 part series. The reason I really like this tutorial is because it starts with the basics of creating a Vue.JS app. There are so many different tools when you start learning javascript like using NPM and Webpack which may be daunting for beginner Javascript programmers, so it removes that aspect and creates a tutorial without them and just uses the script tag to create something which is easier to understand when they tutorial is not throwing curve balls with tools you are not necessarily aware of. Now after the intro this tutorials focuses on the different types of properties, syntax and what is available to use with Vue.JS. Instead of creating something it focuses on things like the reactive property, the DOM, User Events, if and else and much more. Like most introduction programming courses this goes over the basics so you can understand them and use them in what way you see fit.

                 </p>
                   <p>

                     The second tutorial pushes your knowledge a little bit more and assumes you are capable of using github and NPM. However once you get over that hurtle it teaches you how to reate a todo list which is something practical that allows you to understand what it is capable of. Furthermore after it walks you through each step to create a simple todo list you realize that once you refresh the page then all the input will be wiped because it is not locally stored. This tutorial gives the extra effort in showing you how to use local storage to make sure that what modify on the page stays there when you go back to it making it a much more helful and useful tutorial that only shows you the frontend of things.

                    One of the selling points on choosing whether to use a JS library/framework is based on how active the community of users is.
                    Link to the BEST community of users and summarize the community, what is available, etc. in at least one paragraph.

                Any programmer or tech-oriented person has heard of reddit which is a website with a community for everything. That is why I was not surprised to see a specific community for Vue.js. I think this is a great community because it is a singular forum with the sole topic of Vue.js and allows for anyone to post anything relating to that. This--includes but not limited to--tutorials, videos, questions, articles and much more with a huge base behind it to get a good back-and-forth with like-minded individuals who are trying to learn and achieve similar things to what you may be looking for. You can see it is afirly active with about 29000 users and it has a healthy mix of discussions in terms of news, tutorials and questions to further each others knowledge on the subject.

                     <br><h4>Nintendo Rewards</h4>
                 This website really made the effort to make all the UI elements appealing and simple to use, while many may criticize the simplicity of it all. I think it does a great job in executing its vision with simplicity. They incorporate loading animations along with transitions that give the website a top-tier feel. Not to mention they also have hidden menus and popups that provide much more information once they are clicked on which would use Vue.js text interpolation.

                     <br><h4>Harry Potter Quiz</h4>
                 While this website gets the job done in its intended purpose of being a quiz for Harry Potter fans, it tends to be a little bland in terms of the aesthetics of the website. It still does a great job in incorporating certain things about Vue.js like using loading animations, and transitions between the the different questions, storing you data to local storage in case you refresh the page and several other aspects of the DOM.

                 <br><h4>Impressions</h4>
                     I was surprised to see that one of the biggest gaming companies in the world, Nintendo, uses Vue.JS to create their rewards system for its customers. What I like about this framework is that it is dynamic enough to be the basis for UI elements that are integrated into a reward system for Nintendo Rewards. However also capable of creating a quiz format that was used in the Harry Potter Example. This framework would be much easier to work with then normal javascript because it is built on the idea of making certain things much easier then normal Javascript, which would allow you to execute certain conditions in shorthand as opposed to regular Javascript that would require several lines before executing that same result.
